        <h2> Semester Courses </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Web Technology</h3>
                <p>This course aims to provide students with knowledge and required expertise in client-side and server-side scripting for web application development. The course introduces various methods and technologies used in developing web applications
                    including HTML5, CSS, DHTML using jQuery, JAVASRIPT, PHP, and MySQL to develop a complete web site. The course introduces these technologies from the viewpoint of application development and hands-on. The course will conclude with
                    a final project building a basic client website using all of the skills acquired in the course. It is expected that the skills and knowledge gained will help students to develop a web 3.0 applications.

                <h3>Research Methods</h3>
                <p>This course focuses on developing the skills needed to plan, conduct, and report on research in the Computer Science, Information Technology, and Information Systems domains. This course will cover techniques applicable to each of the
                    steps of a research project, including formulating research questions, theory building, data analysis (using both qualitative and quantitative methods), building evidence, assessing validity, and publishing. The approaches that would
                    be used in the delivery of the course will cognitively engage students and also ensure the learning progress of all students irrespective of their gender, academic capability, and ethnicity.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Human-Computer Interaction</h3>
                <p>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) explores the design, evaluation, and usability of interactive systems. It covers topics such as user interface design principles, interaction design methodologies, usability testing, and user experience
                    (UX) research. The course integrates knowledge from psychology, design, and computer science to understand how humans interact with technology and how to create intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable user experiences. Students learn to
                    analyze user needs, design user interfaces, and evaluate system usability, equipping them with skills for designing user-friendly software applications, websites, and digital products.</p>
                <p><strong>Lecturer:</strong> Prof. David White</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Programming Analysis with Java</h3>
                <p>Programming Analysis with Java focuses on the application of Java programming language in problem-solving and software development. It covers topics such as object-oriented programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and software
                    design principles. The course emphasizes the analysis of complex problems and the design of efficient solutions using Java programming constructs. Students learn to write well-structured, modular, and maintainable code, and to apply
